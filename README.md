# CoALFake: Collaborative Active Learning with Human-LLM Co-Annotation for Cross-Domain Fake News Detection

> **Note**: This repository accompanies a paper currently under review. 



## üîç Overview

**CoALFake** is a framework designed to tackle the challenge of cross-domain fake news detection. Traditional models often suffer from domain overfitting and require large amounts of labeled data. CoALFake introduces a **Human-LLM Co-Annotation** approach combined with **Domain-Aware Active Learning** to enhance performance and scalability across varied domains.

**Key Contributions:**
- **LLM-assisted Annotation**: Efficient labeling using large language models, with optional human review.
- **Domain Embedding Integration**: Learns rich, domain-aware representations.
- **Active Learning Strategy**: Selects high-value samples with diverse domain representation.
- **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Outperforms baselines across political, health, and other domains.
